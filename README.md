# Exercise: Median Earnings in New York, by County

### Summary

This exercise examines median earnings in New York for the 
population 16 years and older who had any earnings. Just FYI, earnings 
refers labor income and excludes income from capital (physical or 
financial assets) and transfer payments from the government.

### Input Data

There are two input files: **ny_counties.zip**, the county
shapefile from the earlier exercise, and **earn_by_county.csv**,
a CSV file containing Census data on earnings.

### Deliverables

There are two deliverables: (1) a QGIS project file called 
**earn_by_county.gqz**; and (2) a PNG file called 
**earn_by_county.png** that will be a heat map of median 
earnings. 

### Instructions

1. Build a heat map of the median earnings in `'earn_by_county.csv'` 
using `ny_counties.zip`. Please set up the heat map using 
quantiles with five classes and the "Spectral" color ramp.

1. Please save the QGIS project as `earn_by_county` in the GitHub 
directory for the assignment. 

1. Export the image to the GitHub directory as well and call it 
`earn_by_county.png`.

### Submitting

Once you're happy with everything and have committed all of the changes to
your local repository, please push the changes to GitHub. At that point, 
you're done: you have submitted your answer.

### Tips

+ Using the same base name, `earn_by_county`, for all of the files is handy 
because it keeps related files together in directories with large numbers 
of files. It also helps reduce confusion since it's very clear that the 
files are all part of a single conceptual task.
